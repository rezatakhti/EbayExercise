## Decisions Made
- App architecture follows MVVM with Combine for bindings 
- Used UIKit for the feed list and SwiftUI for the detail page
- App supports dark mode and dynamic type 
- async/await for support for iOS 15.0+ with fallback on completion handlers for previous versions 
- Deeplinking into Apple Music with selected song
